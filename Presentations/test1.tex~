% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection[A Look at Argumentation]{Arguments}

\begin{frame}{Anatomy of an Argument}{Parsons}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Setting.
    \item Target.
      \item Reasoning Structure.
    
    Main elements to an Argument.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Anatomy of an Argument}{Rhetorician}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Audience.
    \item Context.
      \item Purpose.
%   Main elements for Rhetoric
  \end{itemize}
Main elements of Rhetoric
\end{frame}


\subsection{Second Subsection}

\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative.}
\end{frame}



\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

  % Keep the summary *very short*.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \alert{first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
  \end{itemize}
  
  % The following outlook is optional.
