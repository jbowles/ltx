The abstract submission process hasseveral steps: (1) submission of a preliminary, initial abstract, byOctober 20, 2006, to the appropriate minisymposium (2) notification of abstract acceptance, by November 17, 2006, and (3) submission of final abstract, in print ready form, by January 25, 2007.\vspace{12pt}The final abstract length should not exceed 1 page, as the book ofabstracts will adhere to a 1 page per abstract printing. The finalabstract must contain (1) the presentation title, (2) names of thepresentation authors, and (3) contact information for thecorresponding author, including authors' postal and e-mailaddresses. Templates for the preparation of the abstracts in LaTeX,Microsoft Word, and FrameMaker formats may be found on the FEF07website ({\em http://www.esc.sandia.gov/FEF07/FEFhome.html}). Once the abstract isprepared please convert the abstract to PDF format. All abstracts mustbe submitted in electronic form via the web. {\bf Only PDF files will beaccepted}.
