See Chapter \ref{chap:mp}.} But just because they do not use the term ``research program'' does not mean it is irrelevant. In fact, I do not think functionalist theorists would deny that Functionalism is a ``research program.'' Nor would they deny that the various theories under the functionalist umbrella share unifying principles. One can easily see in functionalist writings that they are very aware of their unifying principles.
