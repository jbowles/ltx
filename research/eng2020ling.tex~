An interview with Dan Sperber at \href{http://www.philosophytalk.org/pastShows/LanguageInAction.html}{Philoso?hy Talk}, from 08/22/2006; the interview begins at time 8:50; before that is an explanation and small piece on Mae West; also a quick look at rhetoric: time 50:00. 

\begin{center}
Pragmatics is\ldots \\
{\bf Lingustic study of how context influence or determines meaning}
\end{center}

Pragmatics covers a lot of ground: from conversational implicature, conventional implicature, presuppostion, ambiguity, anaphora (how language makes reference), evidentiality, fallacies, and new/given information. Generally, phenomena dealing with time, space, context, and intention in language and communication are relevent to the applied study of pragmatics.

Areas of application: computer programming, artificial intelligence, philosophy, sociology, and linguistics.

\subsection{Examples}
All examples are context-dependent. 

\subsubsection{Idioms}
\pex \a
\a
\xe

\subsubsection{Reference (deixis, indexicality, anaphor, cataphora}
\pex \a {\bf I} am here right now. $= indexical$
\a {\bf I} said over {\bf there} {\bf that} was an amazing story {\bf then}. $= indexical/person, place, discourse, time $
\a He was the one who took a picture of her but only after they dated. $= anaphora$
\a She is the one, yes, Susan. $= cataphora$
\xe

\subsubsection{Ambiguity}
\pex \a You are a scoundrel. 
\a You are so smart.
\xe

\subsubsection{Implicature (conversational or conventional)}
{\bf Conversational}
\pex \a Can you pass the salt?
\a $\models$ Pass the salt to me.
\xe

\noindent {\bf Conventional}
\pex \a Honestly, has Ed fled?
\a $\approx$ Provide me with an honest answer to {\sl Has Ed fled?}.
\xe

\pex \a {\sl Even} Lenny Bruce passed the test.
\a $\approx$ Lenny Bruce was among the least likely to pass the test.
\xe

\pex \a Sarah went to the store but bought nothing.
\a $\approx$ Sarah went to the store to buy something.
\xe

Conventional Implicatures are usually associated with presuppositions in that an implicature requires some presupposed content.

\subsubsection{Presupposition}
We can simply refer to presupposition as `assuming' or `implying.' It happens in the case where we take for granted the {\sl assumed truth} of the presumed content as a pre-condition for the utterance to be felicitous.

\pex \a John saw the man with two heads.
\a {\bf Presupposed Content:} There exists a man with two heads.
\xe

\pex \a I don't know about politician X, he's a Muslim you know.
\a Oh no, he is not, he's a great guy with family values and everything!
\a {\bf Presupposed Content:} Muslim men are not ``geat guys''and have no family values.
\xe

\subsubsection{Fallacies}
\pex \a Senator X, have you stopped taking bribes yet?
\a No, yes, well uhh \ldots.
\a {\bf Presupposed Content:} Senator X has taken bribes.
\xe

\pex \a I have never gotten a speeding ticket, therefore I will never get one.
\a {\bf Presupposed Content:} The future is the same as the past.
\xe


\subsubsection{Information: New and Given}
Which of these do you think is appropriate? Why?
\pex \a The research done by (Potts 2007) was influential. It has been used extensively.
\a The research done by Potts (2007) was influential. Potts (2007) has been used extensively.
\a It was done by Potts (2007) and was influential. It has been used extensively.
