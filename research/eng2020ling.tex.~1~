\section{Syntax}
\begin{quote}
``You cannot end a sentence in a preposition''
\end{quote}
\begin{center}
Syntax is\ldots \\
{\bf Lingustic study of the patterns and principles of clause \& constituent structure}
\end{center}

Syntax covers many sentence and constituent structure issues, which includes a massive array of topics: word order, noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases, grammatical relations (subjects, objects, direct objects),  . Generally, anything with relevance to how words are composed in linear orders falls within the domain of syntax.
\\

\underline{Areas of Application:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item computer programming
\item artificial intelligence
\item philosophy
\item composition
\item grammar instruction (1st \& 2nd languages)
\item linguistics
\end{itemize}

\section{Semantics}
\begin{quote}
``...''
\end{quote}
\begin{center}
Semantics is\ldots \\
{\bf Study of the meaning of words and their relations.}
\end{center}

Semantics deals with many areas of language meaning and {\sl interacts with syntax and pragmatics in many ways}: lexical meaning of words, lexicon (vocabulary), anaphora (and all reference), quantifiers (`all,' `every'), definite/indefinite terms (`the', `a'), synonomy (and polysemy, homonymy, and antonymy), thematic roles, truth conditions, metaphor, propositions. Generally, it will deal with anything of relevence to how one knows (or comes to know) linguistically recoverable meaning---by this I mean recoverable from the words or structures used.

\item philology
\item semiotics
\item communication
\item advertising
\item psychology
\item linguistics
\end{itemize}


\section{Pragmatics}
\begin{quote}
``It's not what you said, it's {\sl how} you said it.''
\end{quote}
\begin{center}
Pragmatics is\ldots \\
{\bf Lingustic study of how context influence or determines meaning}
\end{center}

Pragmatics covers a lot of ground: from conversational implicature, conventional implicature, presuppostion, ambiguity, anaphora (how language makes reference), evidentiality, fallacies, and new/given information. Generally, phenomena dealing with time, space, context, and intention in language and communication are relevent to the applied study of pragmatics.

\subsection{Examples}
All examples are context-dependent. Although these examples do not come from scientific literature, they exemplify the concepts we are trying to get at. The most important thing to note here is the following:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{In order to get at the purpose of what a writer is trying to do we must understand the context. In order to be successful in our writing goals we must develop the ability to construct the context in which the audience is to interpret our purposes and intentions.}
\end{quote} 

\subsubsection{Idioms}
\pex \a Mary kicked the bucket.
\a You've got the green light.
\a 
\xe

\subsubsection{Reference (deixis, indexicality, anaphor, cataphora}
\pex \a {\bf I} am here right now. $= indexical$
\a {\bf I} said over {\bf there} {\bf that} was an amazing story {\bf then}. $= indexical/person, place, discourse, time $
\a He was the one who took a picture of her but only after they dated. $= anaphora$
\a She is the one, yes, Susan. $= cataphora$
\xe

\subsubsection{Ambiguity}
\pex \a You are a scoundrel. 
\a You are so smart.
\xe

\subsubsection{Implicature (conversational or conventional)}
{\bf Conversational}
\pex \a Can you pass the salt?
\a $\vdash$ Pass the salt to me.
\xe

\noindent {\bf Conventional}
\pex \a Honestly, has Ed fled?
\a $\approx$ Provide me with an honest answer to {\sl Has Ed fled?}.
\xe

\pex \a {\sl Even} Lenny Bruce passed the test.
\a $\approx$ Lenny Bruce was among the least likely to pass the test.
\xe

\pex \a Sarah went to the store but bought nothing.
\a $\approx$ Sarah went to the store to buy something.
\xe

Conventional Implicatures are often associated with presuppositions in that an implicature sometimes requires presupposed content; this is not always the case.

\subsubsection{Presupposition}
We can simply refer to presupposition as `assuming' or `implying.' It happens in the case where we take for granted the {\sl assumed truth} of the presumed content as a pre-condition for the utterance to be felicitous.

\pex \a John saw the man with two heads.
\a {\bf Presupposed Content:} There exists a man with two heads.
\xe

\pex \a I don't know about politician X, he's a Muslim you know.
\a Oh no, he is not, he's a great guy with family values and everything!
\a {\bf Presupposed Content:} Muslim men are not ``geat guys''and have no family values.
\xe

\subsubsection{Fallacies}
\pex \a Senator X, have you stopped taking bribes yet?
\a No, yes, well uhh \ldots.
\a {\bf Presupposed Content:} Senator X has taken bribes.
\xe

\pex \a I have never gotten a speeding ticket, therefore I will never get one.
\a {\bf Presupposed Content:} The future is the same as the past.
\xe
