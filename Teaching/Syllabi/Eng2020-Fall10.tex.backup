   {\bf Course Outline and Grades}\\
   We will focus on methods of analyzing ideas and how to communicate such methods (and their results) in written form. You will demonstrate your ability to think in written form (and your development) through the following 6 projects ()
   \begin{enumerate}
     \# \item Research History, 2 pgs split as 2 assignments
     \item Rhetorical Analysis, 4-5 pgs
     \item Synthesis, 4-5 pgs
     \item Abstract (proposal), 1pg 
      \item Annotated Bibliography
     \item Research Argument, 10-12 pgs
     \item A number of responses and one exam
   \end{enumerate}

The breakdown of grades and letter grade assignment will be according to the following:
\vskip 2mm
  
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Attendance & 15\\
Responses/Exam & 15\\
4 Short Papers & 45\\
1 Final Paper & 20\\
Portfolio & 5\\
\hline
\end{tabular} \  \  \  \  \ \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
   \hline
   93-100 gives A &  73-76 gives C\\
   90-92 gives A- & 70-72 gives C-\\

   83-86 gives B & 63-66 gives D\\

 Notice that I run an equivalent points = percentage scale: one point equals one percent. Keep this in mind when I say that something is worth $n$ points.

\paragraph{The Focus of this class}   
is primarily on research that you will be directing yourself. This means that you need to develop a research agenda in conjunction with the course outline and goals. There is time given at the beginning of the semester to help you find an appropriate topic and develop a strategic course of action. Everything in this class is directed toward the final writing assignment: Paper 4, Classical Argument. This means you should think long-term about projects and you should begin doing research as early as you can.

\begin{comment}
You should find a research topic that engages you. Even things you think might not be ``allowed'' for a college paper (e.g., I have had students write about such varied things as time-travel, medieval knights, Mayan calender, alien life, \emph{et cetera}). The point of attending University is to get the chance to have a \textbf{transformative experience}. You can have a good experience in this class, and do interesting research, if you pick topics that are really cool.
\end{comment}

 {\bf Portfolio}\\
   Save {\bf ALL} written assignments in this class. I elaborate on this as the semester proceeds.
  \\ 

   {\bf Notes on the Calendar}\\
   \textcolor{red}{ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY}. You are given an allowance of three full days. After that, each full day is worth $-2$ points. Also as the course proceeds we usually change the schedule. I say {\it we} because I take input from students seriously. However, if you miss class you miss the chance to help shape the class, and more importantly, you miss changes to the schedule. It is your responsibility to find out any information you miss.

   {\bf Academic Integrity}\\
 Cheating, plagiarism, or any unethical academic behavior is not tolerated. It will be reported immediately to 
your Major Department and Student Services. See plagiarism policy 
\href{http://www.uvu.edu/english/student/plagiarism.html}{here} or at http://www.uvu.edu/english/student/
