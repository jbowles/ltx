<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >In this course you will continue to develop reading, writing, and thinking skills
related to college-level inquiry. The course emphasizes rhetorical, analytical, and
argumentative techniques intended to help you produce well-reasoned and
carefully researched written arguments in the context of science and technology.
The course embodies the spirit of exploration and inquiry into multiple
perspectives of scientific issues. It highlights literacy in scientific/technical reading
and writing (and thinking), and encourages discovery of how scientific ideas relate
to society as a whole.

<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >I do not expect you to understand supplemental readings, but you must make an
effort. The texts you will be exposed to are primary research material written by
academics (physicists, biologists, neuroscientists, linguists, computer scientists,
mathematicians, philosophers of science, <span 
class="cmsl-12">et cetera</span>). They are very advanced,
highly abstract, and at times very technical. The goal of reading these texts is not
to understand all the details but to get a feel for the general compositional style,
mechanics, rhetoric, and format. Your responses to them need to be thoughtful
and can be about the composition of the piece or the scientific details.
The rationale behind assigning very difficult readings and asking you to
respond is simple: good readers make good writers. The more you see
writing done by and for scientists (as opposed to writing intended for
lay audiences) the better equipped you are to write about technical and
scientific issues. Responses represent a format for experimenting with
how you come to perceive complex technical and scientific ideas through
composition (or composition through complex technical and scientific ideas).
Think of them as your laboratory. If successful, your ability to respond to
complex scientific writing (and thinking) will develop throughout the
course.
