   {\bf Course Outline and Grades}\\
   We will focus on methods of analyzing ideas and how to communicate such methods (and their results) in written form. You will demonstrate your ability to think in written form (and your development) through the following:
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item Informative \& Surprising, 4-6 pgs
     \item Analysis \& Synthesis, 4-6 pgs
     \item Abstract \& Annotated Bibliography, 3 pgs
     \item Final: Classical Argument, 10-12 pgs
     \item A number of responses and one exam
   \end{enumerate}

The breakdown of grades and letter grade assignment will be according to the following:
\vskip 2mm
  
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Attendance & 15\\
Responses/Exams & 15\\
3 Short Papers & 45\\
1 Final Paper & 20\\
Portfolio & 5\\
\hline
\end{tabular} \  \  \  \  \ \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
   \hline
   93-100 gives A &  73-76 gives C\\
   90-92 gives A- & 70-72 gives C-\\
   87-89 gives B+ & 67-69 gives D+\\
   83-86 gives B & 63-66 gives D\\
   80-82 gives B- & 60-62 gives D-\\
   79-77 gives C+ & 00-59 gives E\\

\paragraph{\textcolor{teal}{{\sc Focus of this class}}}     
The focus of this class is primarily on research that you will be directing yourself. This means that you need to develop a research agenda in conjunction with the course outline and goals. There is time given at the beginning of the semester to help you find an appropriate topic and develop a strategic course of action. But since this is Summer, you need to find an appropriate topic by the second week. Additionally, I pick some kind of topic (that I am currently working on) to address throughout the course. This gives some stability and consistency to course lectures and assignments, but \textcolor{blue}{does NOT mean you have to do your research project on this topic}. This topic is undetermined at this point.

\paragraph{Comment}  
You should find something that engages you. Even topics you think might not be ``allowed'' for a college paper (e.g., I have had students write about such varied things as time-travel, medieval knights, Mayan calender, alien life, \textsl{et cetera}). The point of attending University is to get the chance to have a \emph{transformative experience}. You can have a good experience in this class, and do interesting research, if you pick topics that are really cool.\\ 
\ \\
 {\bf Portfolio}\\
   Save {\bf ALL} written assignments in this class. I elaborate on this as the semester proceeds.
  \\ 

   {\bf Notes on the Calendar}\\
   \textcolor{red}{ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY}. As the course proceeds we usually change the schedule. I say {\it we} because I take input from students seriously. However, if you miss class you miss the chance to help shape the class, and more importantly, you miss changes to the schedule. It is your responsibility to find out any information you miss.
   \\ 
       

   {\bf Academic Integrity}\\
 Cheating, plagiarism, or any unethical academic behavior is not tolerated. It will be reported immediately to 
your Major Department and Student Services. See plagiarism policy 
\href{http://www.uvu.edu/english/student/plagiarism.html}{here} or at http://www.uvu.edu/english/student/
plagiarism.html.
