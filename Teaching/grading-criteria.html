   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >What follows are examples pulled off of a number of websites that have published a
set of writing criteria for students in various classes. The point here is to show how
they are very similar and that such devices can be overly obvious. In this class we are
taking a very intuitive approach based on Gricean Maxims&#8212;and if you are paying
attention you will see how Gricean Maxims do not really differ from the comments
below; except the Gricean Maxims are more compact. I also provide these comments
because <span 
class="cmbx-10">they can be useful</span>. However, <span 
class="cmbx-10">we shouldn&#8217;t become too dependent on</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-10">them</span>. Trying to hit &#8220;the target points&#8221; for paper is a tired adn uninspired way to write.
This approach seems to demoralize the dynamic, creative, and imaginative aspect to
writing.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   The following points should really be read <span 
class="cmsl-10">after </span>you have written a number of papers, <span 
class="cmsl-10">not</span>
<span 
class="cmsl-10">before</span>. Once you get into the habit of setting up the expectation of a paper before you have
written a word, you can&#8217;t help but try to meet that structure from the very beginning. Our
approach in this class is more intuitive and simple: &#8220;just write the freakin&#8217; thing&#8221; &#8212; write what
you find interesting and inspiring. Then, after you have spent a good time writing, we will go over
the things mentioned below.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>The basic explanation</h3>
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >From <a 
href="http://mendota.english.wisc.edu/~WAC/page.jsp?id=101&c_type=article&c_id=4" >University of Wisconsin</a>, Steve Kantrowitz (adapted from Nancy Langston)
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002.1"></a>Structure</h4>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Begin your paper with a brief description of the narrative, or a brief episode from it
that suggests or illustrates your thesis. Give your thesis statement, which is a concise
statement of your central argument. Then build your argument in a series of well-structured
paragraphs. Each paragraph should have a topic sentence, and 3 to 5 sentences that clearly
support that topic sentence. Each paragraph should explain ONE idea, not 3 or 4. Each
                                                                            

                                                                            
paragraph should have a clear connection to the ONE idea, not 3 or 4. Pay attention to
transitions! Each paragraph should have a clear connection to the next. End with a
strong conclusion that explains what your thesis tells us about the era of the Civil
War.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.2"></a>Analysis</h4>
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >Remember that each paragraph should advance your argument. Support your thesis with evidence
from your narrative, always remembering to explain what that evidence means. Where necessary,
provide context from other course marterial, but dont lean too heavily on textbooks or lectures.
Your analysis should offer specific insights into aspects of this history that other course materials
describe in general terms; it may also suggest how your evidence challenges other historians
analyses. Without trying to make too broad a claim about the entire Civil War, show how your
narrators experience of change tells us something interesting and important about the
era.
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60002.3"></a>Style</h4>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Clarity comes from knowing what you mean and saying it plainly. Dont try to write like a
writer&#8211;write like a person who wants to be understood. We will reward clear, active,
powerful writing. PLEASE do not use the passive voice. Do not start sentences with It is&#x2026;,
There is&#x2026; or There are&#x2026;. Use active verbs. Revise your paper to remove wordiness,
redundancy, passive voice, and inactive verbs. Make sure that your grammar and spelling
are correct. Careless errors, especially run-ons and comma splices, WILL lower your
grade.
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-70002.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">This</span></span>
   is an example of BAD writing: There were changes in southern society during the war that
made southerners turn their anti-government beliefs against the south.
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-80002.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">This</span></span>
   is an example of BETTER writing: Many white southerners interpreted wartime taxation and
conscription as the same sort of interference with southern domestic relations that the
Confederacy founders had promised to prevent.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   Whats the difference? In the first sentence, There were changes is in the passive voice and
offers no specifics. What sort of changes occurred, and in what context? The passive voice allows
you to evade these questions, but specificity and context are essential to good history. Southerners
is too general; the group in question consists of many (but not all) white southerners.
Anti-government beliefs and the south also lacks precision. White southerners tended to resist
some forms of political authority, but not others; this dynamic shaped both the Confederate state
(which was not the same thing as the south) and the emerging opposition to that states
policies.
                                                                            

                                                                            
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-90002.4"></a>Originality</h4>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Although you can get a good grade (A/B) for a paper based on arguments presented in lectures or
readings, A papers must offer more original insights and arguments. We strongly encourage you to
think for yourselves, building on evidence and arguments from the course but pushing your
insights further than what we cover in lectures.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-100003"></a>Scalar Criteria</h3>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >The following represents a very small collection of the kinds of things you might have been
exposed to. I have taken liberally from the internet and, unfortunately, did not document my
sources very well.
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-110003.1"></a></h4>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >From <a 
href="http://mendota.english.wisc.edu/~WAC/page.jsp?id=101&c_type=article&c_id=4" >University of Wisconsin</a>, Steve Kantrowitz (adapted from Nancy Langston)
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-120003.1.1"></a>The Superior Paper (A)</h5>
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-130003.1.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Structure:</span></span>
   Your thesis is clear, insightful, original, sophisticated, even exciting. All ideas in the paper
flow logically; your argument is identifiable, reasonable, and sound. You have excellent transitions.
Your paragraphs have solid topic sentences, and each sentence clearly relates to that topic
sentence. Your conclusion is persuasive.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-140003.1.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Analysis:</span></span>
   You support every point with at least one example from your primary sources. You integrate
quoted material into your sentences well. Your analysis is fresh and exciting, posing new ways to
think of the material.
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-150003.1.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Style:</span></span>
   Your sentence structure, grammar, spelling, and citations are excellent. You have NO run-on
sentences or comma splices. Your writing style is lively, active, and interesting. You use active
verbs, and do not use the passive voice. You are not wordy or redundant.
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-160003.1.1"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Originality:</span></span>
   Your arguments show a great deal of independent insight and originality.<br 
class="newline" />
                                                                            

                                                                            
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-170003.1.2"></a>The Very Good Paper (A/B)</h5>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-180003.1.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Structure:</span></span>
   Your thesis is clear, insightful, and original. Your argument flows logically and is sound. You
may have a few unclear transitions. You end with a strong conclusion.
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-190003.1.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Analysis:</span></span>
   You give examples to support most points, and you integrate quotations into sentences. Your
analysis is clear and logical, and even makes sense.
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-200003.1.2"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Style:</span></span>
   Your sentence structure, grammar, spelling, and citations are good. You have no more than
one run-on sentence or comma-splice. Your writing style is solid and clear. You use active verbs
and do not use the passive voice. You are not wordy or redundant. Originality: Your arguments
show independent thought.
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-210003.1.3"></a>The Good Paper (B)</h5>
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-220003.1.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Structure:</span></span>
   Your thesis is clear, but may not be insightful, original, or easily identified. Your argument is
generally clear and appropriate, although it may wander occasionally. You may have a few unclear
transitions, or paragraphs without strong topic sentences. You may end without much of a
conclusion.
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-230003.1.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Analysis:</span></span>
   You give evidence to support most points, but some evidence may appear where
inappropriate. Your argument usually makes sense, although some gaps in logic may
exist.
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-240003.1.3"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Style:</span></span>
   Your writing style is clear, but not always lively, active, or interesting. You sometimes use the
passive voice. You may become wordy or redundant. Your sentence structure, grammar, and
spelling are strong despite occasional lapses. Originality: You do a solid job of synthesizing course
material but do not develop your own insights or conclusions.
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-250003.1.4"></a>The Borderline Paper (B/C)</h5>
                                                                            

                                                                            
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-260003.1.4"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Structure:</span></span>
   Your thesis may be unclear, vague, or unoriginal, and it may provide little structure for the
paper. Your paper may wander, with few transitions, few topic sentences, and little logic. Your
paragraphs may not be organized coherently.
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-270003.1.4"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Analysis:</span></span>
   You give examples to support some but not all points. Your points often lack supporting
evidence, or else you use evidence inappropriately, often because there may be no clear point. Your
quotations may be poorly integrated into sentences. You may give a quote, but then fail to analyze
it or show how it supports your argument. Your logic may fail, or your argument may be unclear.
Your end may dwindle off without a conclusion.
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-280003.1.4"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Style:</span></span>
   Your writing style is not always clear, active, or interesting. You use the passive voice, or
become wordy or redundant. You have repeated problems in sentence structure, grammar,
punctuation, citation style, or spelling. You may have several run-on sentences or comma splices.
Originality: You do a fair job of synthesizing course material but do not develop your own insights
or conclusions.

class="cmbx-10">Structure:</span></span>
   Your thesis is difficult to identify, or it may be a bland restatement of an obvious point. Your
structure may be unclear, often because your thesis is weak or non-existent. Your transitions are
confusing and unclear. Your paragraphs show little structure. The paper is a loose collection of
statements, rather than a cohesive argument.

 id="x1-310003.1.5"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Analysis:</span></span>
   Your examples are few or weak. You fail to support statements, and the evidence you give is
poorly analyzed, poorly integrated into the paper, or simply incorrect. Your argument may be
impossible to identify. Ideas may not flow at all, often because there is no argument to
support.
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a

   Your writing style has problems in sentence structure, grammar, and diction. You have
frequent major errors in citation style, punctuation, and spelling. You may have many run-on
sentences and comma splices. Originality: You do a confusing or poor job synthesizing
material presented in lectures and sections, and you do not develop your own insights or
conclusions.

href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/html/icb.topic58474/GradingPapers.html" >Harvard University</a>, Lewis Hyde, edited by Sue Lonoff, with thanks to Richard Marius&#8217;s
writing handbook.<br 
class="newline" />The following remarks are intended to give you a sense of criteria for grading papers. Note that
four topics recur: thesis, use of evidence, design (organization), and basic writing skills (grammar,
mechanics, spelling). In courses with multiple graders or teaching fellows, it is essential
that a unform grading standard be discussed and adapted by those grading students&#8217;
work.

<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >The D or F paper either has no thesis or else it has one that is strikingly vague, broad, or
uninteresting. There is little indication that the writer understands the material being presented.
The paragraphs do not hold together; ideas do not develop from sentence to sentence. This paper
usually repeats the same thoughts again and again, perhaps in slightly different language but often
in the same words. The D or F paper is filled with mechanical faults, errors in grammar, and
errors in spelling.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-360003.2.2"></a>The C Paper.</h5>
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >The C paper has a thesis, but it is vague and broad, or else it is uninteresting or obvious. It does
not advance an argument that anyone might care to debate. &#8221;Henry James wrote some interesting
novels.&#8221; &#8221;Modern cities are interesting places.&#8221;
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   The thesis in the C paper often hangs on some personal opinion. If the writer is a recognized
authority, such an expression of personal taste may be noteworthy, but writers gain authority not
merely by expressing their tastes but by justifying them. Personal opinion is often the
engine that drives an argument, but opinion by itself is never sufficient. It must be
defended.
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   The C paper rarely uses evidence well; sometimes it does not use evidence at all. Even if it
has a clear and interesting thesis, a paper with insufficient supporting evidence is a C
paper.
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   The C paper often has mechanical faults, errors in grammar and spelling, but please note: a
paper without such flaws may still be a C paper.

<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >The reader of a B paper knows exactly what the author wants to say. It is well organized, it
                                                                            

                                                                            
presents a worthwhile and interesting idea, and the idea is supported by sound evidence presented
in a neat and orderly way. Some of the sentences may not be elegant, but they are clear, and in
them thought follows naturally on thought. The paragraphs may be unwieldy now
and then, but they are organized around one main idea. The reader does not have to
read a paragraph two or three times to get the thought that the writer is trying to
convey.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   The B paper is always mechanically correct. The spelling is good, and the punctuation is
accurate. Above all, the paper makes sense throughout. It has a thesis that is limited and worth
arguing. It does not contain unexpected digressions, and it ends by keeping the promise to argue
and inform that the writer makes in the beginning.

<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >The A paper has all the good qualities of the B paper, but in addition it is lively, well paced,
interesting, even exciting. The paper has style. Everything in it seems to fit the thesis exactly. It
may have a proofreading error or two, or even a misspelled word, but the reader feels that these
errors are the consequence of the normal accidents all good writers encounter. Reading the paper,
we can feel a mind at work. We are convinced that the writer cares for his or her ideas, and about
the language that carries them.
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   The sure mark of an A paper is that you will find yourself telling someone else about
it.

<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >Ideas&#8212;An A paper is an interesting and sophisticated response to the topic. The central idea or
thesis is clearly stated, worthy of development, and suitably specific; usually the thesis constitutes
a thoughtful answer to a question worth asking. The paper recognizes the complexity of the topic
or question, acknowledging contradictions, qualifications or limits of the thesis while
sustaining logical development. Support&#8212;It uses evidence appropriately and effectively,
providing sufficient and convincing support for its main ideas. If it uses outside sources,
it does so with a competent controlling touch, critically evaluating as necessary, and
showing clear comprehension. It appropriately defines terms and limits its scope, and cites
useful illustrative examples. Organization and Coherence&#8212;An A paper has a logical
structure appropriate to the subject, purpose, audience, and discipline. Usually, transitional
sentences lead the reader from one idea to the next, and/or identify the logical relations
between ideas and thesis. Paragraphs make clear points that support the main idea,
and paragraphs demonstrate coherence and continuity. Style&#8212;An A paper shows a
clear command of English prose, with words chosen for their precise meanings, and an
appropriate level of specificity and sophistication. Sentence style fits the audience and
purpose; sentences are varied, yet clearly structured and carefully focused&#8211;neither long and
rambling nor short and choppy. Mechanics&#8212;An A paper contains few, if any, errors in
spelling, punctuation, or grammar, and observes all applicable conventions of format and

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3.2   </span> <a

<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >Ideas&#8212;B paper has a clearly stated thesis that responds appropriately to the topic. It
demonstrates understanding of the question, acknowledging the central idea&#8217;s complexity or
significance, but it may handle the ideas in a less sophisticated and effective way. Support&#8212;The B
paper offers reasons for supporting the points it makes, using varied kinds of evidence,
but the evidence may need further evaluation or qualification. Connections between
main ideas and evidence may need some clarifying, and definition of terms may not
be smoothly accomplished, but the logic is solid. Examples do support a thesis, but
development may be somewhat incomplete. Organization&#8212;The B paper demonstrates a
logical progression of ideas, and offers the reader transitional links; each paragraph
relates to the paper&#8217;s central idea, but the connections may be less sophisticated and
effective than those of the A paper. Sentences coherently support their paragraph&#8217;s topic
sentences. Style&#8212;The prose of a B paper is accurate and effective, but may sometimes be
too general; sentences are mostly clear and well-structured, though there may be an
occasional awkward or ineffective construction. Mechanics&#8212;B paper may contain a
few mechanical or grammatical errors, but they do not impede understanding; format
and other considerations are substantially correct and appropriate for the subject or
discipline.

   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-420003.3.3"></a>C paper is an adequate response to the topic:</h5>
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" >Ideas&#8212;The C paper responds to the topic, but presents its central idea in general terms, not
striking an appropriate level of specificity and precision. The paper may not offer insights beyond
the most obvious, and the thesis does not engage the topic&#8217;s key questions with sufficient clarity
and control. The paper may restate the question unnecessarily, or may overlook important
aspects. Support&#8212;If it acknowledges other views, the C paper may exhibit only a basic
comprehension of source material, with some lapses in understanding. Definitions may be
simply dictionary quotations, not integrated into a flow of ideas, and the relevance of
examples may not be clear. C papers often inappropriately depend on unsupported
opinion or personal experience, or assume that the evidence speaks for itself; there
may be lapses in logic and the development may be perfunctory. Organization&#8212;The C
paper may list ideas or arrange them ineffectively rather than using a logical structure;
transitions are likely to be sequential (first, second, third) rather than logical links.
While each paragraph relates to the central idea, the flow of ideas may not be smooth,
and arrangement of sentences may occasionally be ineffective. Style&#8212;The C paper
usually exhibits some vague word choice or inappropriately general terms, and though
sentence structure is generally correct there may be some sentences that are wordy or
unfocused or choppy. Meaning may be diffused through cumbersome constructions and may
inappropriately depend on jargon or buzz-words. Mechanics&#8212;The C paper may contain
some minor mechanical or grammatical errors, but they are not enough to impede
understanding.

 id="x1-430003.3.4"></a>D paper does not adequately respond to the assignment:</h5>
<!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >Ideas&#8212;The paper does not have a clear central idea, or responds to the assignment in a simplistic
or perfunctory way. The thesis may be vague or unrecognizable, may be too obvious to be
developed effectively, or may demonstrate only a surface-level approach to the topic.
Support&#8212;The D paper may show a misunderstanding of sources, or may rely too heavily on them
at the expense of clear exposition; it may depend on clichès or overgeneralizations
for support, or may offer little evidence of any kind. The D paper&#8217;s examples are not
convincing: it may rely on personal narrative when an essay is called for, or it may simply
summarize when analysis is required. Paragraphs may be too short to do justice to the topic.
Organization&#8212;D papers often have random organization, using few or inappropriate transitions;
paragraphs may lack clear logical links to the central idea, and paragraph length may be
inappropriate (long undivided blocks or choppy short units). D papers often contain
paragraphs with little relevance to the topic, or whose relevance requires considerable
authorial explanation. Style&#8212;D paper may be overly vague and abstract, or overly
personal and specific, but in any case its style is inadequate for the task at hand. It
usually contains frequent awkward or ungrammatical sentences, or employs &#8220;correct&#8221;
sentences that are inappropriately simple or monotonous. Mechanics&#8212;The mechanical and
grammatical errors in a D paper are severe enough or frequent enough to impede a reader&#8217;s
understanding. Format may be inappropriate, or may indicate neglect or misreading of
instructions.

including sentence-level competence; major and repeated deviations from accepted English usage
and grammar may fail a paper. A paper may fail because it is off topic, of inappropriate length, or
too full of logical or other flaws; moreover, papers that lean inappropriately hard on source
material (with or without acknowledgment) also fail, as do papers whose coherence is detectable

such a way that the reader feels significantly taught by the author. The writer sustains a
thoughtful, analytic argument, looking at ideas from more than one point of view, asking
difficult questions and following them up with analysis. Sometimes a paper achieves an A
because a student develops a thoughtful and well-defined interpretive approach and
an awareness of his or her own position in relation to the positions in the assigned
readings.
