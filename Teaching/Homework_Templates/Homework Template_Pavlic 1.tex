\begin{homeworkProblem}
\texttt{Directions:
Look at the following syllogisms and answer the questions as either \textsc{Yes} or \textsc{No}}.\footnote{A syllogism, both technically and classically, only has two premises. When it has more, or an argument is composed of a series of syllogisms, it is called a \textbf{sorite}, a Greek word meaning `pile.'} 

\ex. Do the conclusions follow from the premises?

\ex. Are the conclusions true in the real world?

\ex. Are there any examples where the conclusions follow from the premises, but either the conclusions or the premises are not true in the real world?
\a. Which examples are these?
\b. How do you know the premises/conclusions are not true?


\begin{syllogism} Pakistani\\
All Pakistanis are Moslems\\
No Sinhalese are Moslems\\
Therefore, no Sinhalese are Pakistani's.\\
\end{syllogism}

\begin{syllogism} Accidents\\
Accidents are frequent\\
Getting struck by lighteing is an accident\\
Therefore, getting struck by lightening is frequent.\\
\end{syllogism}

\begin{syllogism} Mormons\\
All Mormons are pious persons\\
No Samoans are Mormons\\
Therefore, no Samoans are pious persons.\\
\end{syllogism}

\begin{syllogism} Identity\\
All cells die and regenerate,\\
X is composed of cells,\\
(Therefore,) X is always dying and regenerating,\\
X is always dying and regenerating,\\
There exists an identity which is a property of X,\\
Therefore, The identity of X is always dying and regenerating.\\
\end{syllogism}

\begin{syllogism} Numbers\\
Some prime numbers are integers\\
All rational numbers are real numbers\\
All integers are rational numbers\\
Some prime numbers are real numbers.\\
