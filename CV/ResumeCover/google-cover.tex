\maketitle

My interest in working at Google is to enhance my professional experience by working with leaders and innovators in the field of software engineering and programming. I am specifically interested in computational applications to and with natural languages. I represent a newer breed of programmer: half linguist and half hacker. My BA and MA degrees have been done in traditional linguistics programs; while my PhD will be done in the newer field of computational linguistics. To this end, I am looking to gain as much real world computational experience before starting my PhD.

I realize that I do not have the traditional background for a software engineer. Because of this, I can bring to Google a set of different syntactic/semantic and pattern-recognition skills. I see code through the eyes of a linguist, and this gives me a unique perspective on the potential of such code. For example, my study and research in formal pragmatics gives me a unique perspective on the problem of context in discourse, and how to implement parsing technology that can deal with language problems arising from contextual ambiguity. 

I look forward to the chance at sharing and learning all that I can with you.
