\chapter*{Preface}
\begin{quote}
     \textsl{Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different}.\\ --T.S. Eliot
\end{quote}


I would imagine the quote from Eliot could apply also to world of mathematics; one might addend it with the line ``and genius creates directly from nature.'' I am far from a mature mathematician, and hope one day to be a good one; at least in terms of my respective field of application and theory of mathematical formaliztions to the study of natural language linguistics. If the quote above were truely accurate here then I would be doing more imitating then stealing\ldots, but the truth is that I do more stealing than anything.

This book is intended as a study guide for myself; if you are reading it then I have made it public for whatever reason. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Please do not cite this reference guide}}. I have taken liberally from multiple sources and have not been too cautious in making sure that I have not plagiarized. The reason for this is becuase I want to make sure the mathematics I present here is credible: proofs, examples, theorems, and so on. I have modified many examples and such, but only when I was sure of the outcome; if there was every any question on my part I simply copied freely in order to ensure that this personal study guide was true to the facts. 

The following sources have both inspired and guided me, and represent sources that I have either borrowed from, or flatly taken taken material out of (without permission by the way): \cite{gustfriskalgebra}, \cite{mathbook}, \cite{pmw:1990}, \cite{kleene:1967}, and \ldots. Of particular note is \posscitet{silvthomp}, originally written in 1910, and commendable for its Prologue which bears quoting in length.
