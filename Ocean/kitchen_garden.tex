The past is a strange beast. I had a dream last night about two people I once knew, Angus Hicks and Jerry Payne, and when I woke up I wanted to see them. I know both of these guys from my time in Denver. My Denver time is only time in life I felt like I truly made friends. I miss those guys.

For some time I have wanted to take you two girls to Denver. I want to take you to eat at a restuarant. It was at this restuarant that I made my friends. Jerry Payne, Angus HIcks, Don Hudson, Teri Rippetto. They all revolved around ``the restuarant".
