\chapter*{Preface}
I have wanted to begin this project many times; I finally started on Christmas eve of two-thousand nine. The guiding motivation behind such a project is to leave a record of my life for my children. 

Our children come to our lives knowing only a part of us. Much of a parent's early life, whether before having children or when the children were too young to remember who we were, is better not told; and rarely is. I understand this latter sentiment, but I also understand the importance of leaving a record. I also believe in children \textsl{eventually} knowing about their parents' lives. In many ways, our struggles as human individuals become thier struggles too. The failures and frustrations, false starts, dreams, and dark hours that have molded us into the people we are today also mold our children in ways not always obvious. Our successes as parents and individuals are singularities in the backdrop of the ocean of life: our private discovery of what it means to have a life is seldom passed on to our children in substantive form. It is a shame that our children rarely have access to the horizon of our past, that they cannot explore our own vast journey. 

This book is meant to make up for the lack of access children have to their parents' past. And though I have not written it yet, I am sure there will be things about me they wished were not true, but I beleive in the end they will be glad for the perspective. I hope my children do not read this until they are grown, and I hope that once they do read it, the book will shed light on their own lives and their own continuous journey through life.
