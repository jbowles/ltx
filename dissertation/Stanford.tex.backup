\section{Personal}
I am looking to study formal-computational semantics and pragmatics. I have a nice base in descriptive, typological-functional theories from study under Stephanie Robin Quizar and Lyle Campbell, as well as in minimalist syntax from Aniko Csirmaz and Ed Rubin. Now I want to study more formal techniques. One of my main interests is Evidentiality. This came from working with Tukanoan languages, and presently I am looking into how languages without grammatical evidentials may possibly encode evidential (or epistemic modal) interpretations. I am also interested in building ontologies and formal models of context for evidential reasoning, presupposition, and implicature. 

At first I was not going to apply to Stanford Linguistics, even though I have always wanted to get my PhD here. I was not sure that my interests in pragmatics and semantics aligned well with enough of the faculty's interests. However, given new additions to the department, I see that my interests are broadly represented in the linguistics faculty and I know I could be a productive member of the community. 

\subsection{GRE Scores}
Unfortunately, my 4 year old GRE scores do not accurately reflect my ability. I know why the scores are low and am correcting this by re-taking the GRE. However, since I only recently decided to apply to Stanford (as of November 18), my new scores will not be submitted in time. (That is, the deadline of December 8 is much earlier than the other schools I am applying to and I don't re-take the GRE until December 10). In effect, and specifically regarding the low quantitative score, I was naive about preparing for the exam and thought that because I was doing active research and writing, as well as studying mathematical logic and abstract algebra on my own, I would be fine without studying for the actual test. I am not proud of my naivet\'e and will convince you that the GRE scores that have been submitted do not reflect my actual ability.

\section{Research}
I am generally interested in applying various linguistic theories to solve real-world problems in both scientific and industry related domains. I enjoy finding ways to use definitions and ideas from mathematical logic, computability theory, and abstract algebra to build rigorous models for explaining natural language data. Presently, I am learning as much as I can about (i) basic computer usage (having recently switched over to a Linux environment), (ii) natural language processing (including languages such as Python and Lisp), and (iii) statistics and probablility.   

The following subsections list current and future projects I would like to continue in my doctoral studies. 

\subsection{Current Projects}
\ex. \textsl{English Corpus of Evidentiality Data} (goal of 1 million sentences/clauses; presently at about .02\% of goal).

\ex. \textsl{Evidentiality and the Human Mind: Language, Information, and Human Discourse} (\texttt{Project under review for funding by the NEH Summer Stipend 2010}). 

\ex. \textsl{Some Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics of Evidentiality in English}. Ms., 29 pgs: version 1.3. 

\ex. \textsl{Recursion for Computation's Sake}. Ms., 24 pgs: version 1.

\ex. \textsl{Ambiguous Merge, Symmetry, and Group Theory}. Ms., 27 pgs: version 2. 
\a.  \textsl{A Note on Ideal Structure for a Hypothetical Operation}. Revision in progress for future squib submission.

\subsection{Future Project Interests}
\ex. Computing Fixed Phrases and Idioms by Named Entity Recognition.

\ex. Statistical Patterns for Syntactic and Pragmatic Structures in English Evidentiality. 

\ex. A Model for the Projection Problem Using Algebraic Group Theory.

\ex. Formalizing Context.

\ex. Ontology and Knowledge Representation for Evidentiality.

I am also considering studying a language with a large web presence: starting Mandarin, or continuing German or Spanish.
