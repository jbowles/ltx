Statement of purpose
Your statement of purpose is an important part of your application.  Program admission committees consider them carefully in ranking applicants.  Be as specific as possible about your research interests and qualifications.  If you have particular reasons for choosing Northwestern, be sure to indicate them.  

Your statement may be submitted electronically as part of the online application.  The statement may not exceed 5,000 characters.  You may find it useful to compose your statement using word processing software, then to cut and paste it into the online application.  However, should you desire to submit your statement on paper, a copy of this statement should be submitted along with the other supporting materials you send to the program to which you are applying.  Be sure that your identification - full name, birth date, and the program to which you are applying - are listed below the title.

Graduate Program Application Information
Where can I find out about general requirements and procedures for applying to a graduate program at Northwestern University?
Follow these links:

General information about Northwestern's admission process
General information regarding application materials, including payment of the application fee, and up-to-date information on test scores
Information on financial aid.
Online application
How early may I submit an application?
October 1st for admission the following Fall Quarter.

What is the application deadline?
December 31st for admission the following Fall Quarter.

Are there any additional program-specific materials that must be included in an application to a graduate program in Linguistics?
Like many programs at Northwestern, Linguistics requires GRE scores for admission. For more on the GRE, please click here. In addition, the Linguistics Department requires applicants to submit a writing sample. The length of this writing sample is highly variable, but typically it is at least 3-5 pages long with a highly variable upper limit. Some applicants submit an entire MA thesis, while others send in just a 3-5 page paper written for a class at their undergraduate institution. As for the topic, anything that is related to Linguistics is fine, it certainly doesn't have to be in the area of Linguistics that the applicant is hoping to specialize in. The main purpose of the writing sample is to give us an idea of the applicant's written expression ability.

Who should I ask to write the two letters of recommendation?
Letters of recommendation should be written by anyone in a position to evaluate your potential for graduate study in Linguistics. There are no requirements regarding the position of the letter writer, however, it is highly recommended that at least one letter come from a former or current professor. In the case of an applicant who has been out of school for some time, a letter from a recent or current supervisor is also very helpful. Please note that we require a minimum of 2 letters of recommendation, however there is no maximum. It is often appropriate to include up to 4-5 letters, especially (but not exclusively) in the case of an applicant with extensive work experience beyond the undergraduate degree.

Where should hard copies of the supplemental application materials be sent?
Any hard copies of application materials, with the exception of the application fee, must be sent to the Linguistics Department at this address:\\

Department of Linguistics \\
Northwestern University \\
2016 Sheridan Road \\
Evanston, Illinois 60208-4090\\

What is the application review process at the level of the NU Graduate School?
For information on the Graduate School application review process go to this website.

What is the application review process at the level of the NU Linguistics Department?
Once the application deadline has passed (December 31), the graduate admission committee begins to review applications. All applications are reviewed very carefully and close attention is paid to each and every part of the application package including test scores (GRE and TOEFL), undergraduate academic record, writing sample, letters of recommendation and the personal statement. At some point in late January/early February, we make the first round of admissions offers and invite those applicants with offers to attend our Annual Applicant Visit Weekend. In accordance with the Resolution Regarding Graduate Scholars, Fellows, Trainees, and Assistants of the Council of Graduate Schools, applicants who receive an offer prior to April 15th, have until that date to accept or decline the offer. Offers made after April 15th typically expire after 2-3 weeks. Given this schedule, our entering class for any given year is usually finalized by late April/early May. At that point (if not sooner), all applicants should have been notified regarding the final status of their application.

Applicants to the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy are required to submit a writing sample as part of their application. Writing samples should be
submitted electronically.\\ Please go to \\http://www.dlp.mit.edu/admissions\\ for further instruction. Applicants to the linguistics program are very strongly urged to send a copy of a {\bf major research paper (a term paper, research report, or thesis). The paper need not be about linguistics, but it should demonstrate an applicant's ability to pursue serious scholarly inquiry}.
Applicants to the philosophy program should submit a writing sample in philosophy, ideally of 15-25 pages in length. The writing sample should allow us to assess the applicant's understanding of a philosophical problem, and ability to evaluate philosophical arguments. This assessment is usually easier if the writing sample explicitly engages with some of the contemporary philosophical literature. Applicants to the Linguistics Program are NOT required to complete the Record of Courses Taken in Preparation for Graduate Study form. Applicants to the Philosophy Program are required to list only relevant texts and authors on the Record of Courses Taken in Preparation for Graduate Study form.\\
